# MineSweeper

This is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game in C++. The game provides a console-based interface where players can uncover tiles and avoid mines.

Mine density is customizable to be able to create a level as hard or easy as wanted. The mines are distributed randomly to make sure players cannot win by relying on previous games.

run file immediately opens terminal based on the current code within TestGame.cpp to show how it works. The game can be customized through TestGame.cpp and then initialized once more into a new file.
